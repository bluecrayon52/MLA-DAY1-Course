<h3>There are a few Missing Values</h3>
 You always should look for missing values in your data during your Exploratory Data Analysis tasks (EDA).<br>
 How to interpret and handle these missing values depends of a series of circunstances related to the business problem that the dataset represents and how the data was collected. Depending on this analysis we can drop them or imput new values. <br>
 As it is not in the scope of this course and there are few of them here, we are not doing anything about this, just keeping them.
