<h3>Discussion</h3>
Just looking at the relative position of the features, by comparing the original dataset and the one with the new engineered features, we can observe that Edition and hard-paper keep the same position, appearing in the second place. They share the same information and this makes sense. For the other features extracted from Edition, year and month, seems that AutoGluon does a better job in extracting information form the original one.
For the new numerical feature devived from the original Ratings feature, seems that Autogluon gives more importance for the numerical version. We can see that AutoGluon detects small changes related to feature importance, but these differences are not relevant as AutoGluon does a remarkable job extracting information from any kind of feature.
This doesn't change the fact that feature engineering has a very important role improving machine learning results in general when you are not using an AutoML model, like AutoGluon.
